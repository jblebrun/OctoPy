# OctoPy
Compiler for John Earnest's Octo Chip-8\* assembly language, written in Python


## Why?

Mostly, as an exercise for myself, I haven't written very many parsers.

I've written a few Chip-8 emulators in the past. I always write the emulators, and then never bother to play around much with the actual Chip-8 language. Discovering Octo changed this for me; now it's fun and easy to cobble together little tests and demos to run in my emulators.

 I've been using Octo to write small programs to help test [8boy](https://github.com/jblebrun/8boy), my Chip-8 emulator for Arduboy, as well as to try to put together a small game for OctoJam 2020. Eventually, I hope to include this Python version of the compiler with 8boy, to make it easy to put games written with Octo onto an Arduboy.

## Notes
[OctoSummary.md](OctoSummary.md) is a brief overview of the language that I made to refer to as I wrote the compiler. It includes a summary of all the instructions and directives, and notes on how they map to Chip8 instructions.
